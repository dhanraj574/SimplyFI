Logo Component
Overview
This project contains a React component named Logo that displays a logo with a brown background, four colored bars forming a square, and centered text. The logo design is created using HTML, CSS, and React. The bars blend together in a visually appealing manner while the brown background does not affect their individual colors.

Features
Rotated Design: The logo is rotated 45 degrees, giving the bars a square formation.
Blended Colors: The colors of the bars blend naturally when they overlap, without interference from the background color.
Responsive Layout: The logo is centered on the page both vertically and horizontally.
Text Content: The logo contains two lines of text with different font sizes and a highlighted character.
